# The Stack

The Stack is a todo app with only a limited set of features. Similar to the data structure it's named for, it's mostly a simple list of items that need to be done, but there will be a few features that make it more useful to, well, me.

## Features
- Create stacks.
- Save tasks to a stack.
- Add a due date to single tasks, or to a whole stack.
- Stacks can contain other stacks.
- The joke here is that Stacks are actually Tasks with children.
- Surprise! It's a tree.

I'm writing this in .NET because I need to learn it for work. Maybe I'll also write it in Go, then in JS/TS. I don't know.
